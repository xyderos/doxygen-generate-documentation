# Generate documentation for your project by using Doxygen via docker

Tired of trying to configure auto-documentation projects?

__Just use doxygen!__

1) __Put the project folder inside this repo__
2) __Run the script__
3) __Done!__

    #### __For Ubuntu users, firefox will most likely deny to open the file (but will open the directory) due to [that](https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1972762), a workaround would be to:__

    1) Either delete the firefox snap and install the .deb package
    2) Or copy the __Documentation__ folder to the root and then back to the folder you would wish to have the documentation

4) __Open the Documentation folder with your browser and open index.html__
